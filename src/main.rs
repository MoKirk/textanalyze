 * text:
 * - is the struct with the file data
 *
 * linters:
 * - diffrent linters are available to parse the text
 *
 * output
 * - How to print the output from the input
 *
 * TODO:
 * - [x] create a text struct with line and sentence parser
 * - [ ] create an input which returns the text from a file
 * - [ ] create an output which gets the text
 * - [x] create a first linter
 * - [ ] how can I make linter multilanguage?
 * - [ ] Check: Is the linter output okay or is it too complicated?
