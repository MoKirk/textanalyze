 *
 * output
 * - How to print the output from the input

 * TODO:
 * - [ ] create a text struct with line and sentence parser
 * - [ ] create an input which returns the text from a file
 * - [ ] create an output which gets the text
 * - [ ] create a first linter
 * - [ ] how can I make linter multilanguage?
